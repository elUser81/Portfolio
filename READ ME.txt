Hello and welcome to my Github repository! 

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my abilities with a variety
of data-science tools such as sklearn, numpy, seaborn, tensorflow, and others. 

Currently, I'm going through all of the major machine learning algorithms and
demonstrating my knowledge and ability to apply these tools to relevent sets of data. 

I will also be posting my more advanced projects related to my hobbies: Quantitative Finance
and Physics Simulations once I organize the code for readability. 

I actively update this portfolio with work that I do throughout my college and professional
carrer. I also reccomend that you check out my work on binary star accretion disk imaging, which
is my most recent project. This project was very challenging and I learned some great skills throughout its 
development. I am currently writing my final thesis on that code. The most recent drafts of each chapter
be found under 'Thesis Chapters' in the eclipse mapping repository. 

My ultimate goal is to get a PhD in Mathematical Physics and do academic research.
However, I've come to love data science as a career in the meantime and intend to pursue
it along with my physics research. 

If you would like to contribute to any of my projects, feel free to contact me! I really
enjoy collaborating with others and would alway appreciate an extra set of eyes. 
My updated contact info is on my resume in this repository.

Thankyou!
